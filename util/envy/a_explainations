So a few comments on the Input structure:

there are two types of Quotes and also two types of variables, which change the layout of the input
1 VAR
there are normal ENV-Variables, declared in the environment and stored in the shell
	-> the ms_getenv() returns a reference to the values in order to copy from there, pls don't change them using this function
additionally there are a few other variable keys, which are not stored as ENV, but we can hardcode some
whenever in the input a >$< symbol is encountered the characters immedialy following it (->NAMECON) are used as <key> to find the 
corresponding <value>
Notice tho, that unless we are currently between doubleQuotes, the > < will be seen as delimeter between arguments
2 QUOTES
anything between doubleQuotes will be interpreted as one argument, and variables will be replaced with their values
anything between singleQuotes will be interpreted as one argument, but variable <key>s will not be changed
IMPORTANT
	it always depends on the outer quotation:
	"lal'$PATH'lel" will display the PATH
	'lal"$PATH"lel' won't display the path
the outer quotes are not part of the actual input

wether the input is valid for each command is to be checked after the input has been reworked


NAMECON
there is a namingconvention to variablenames: only Alphanumerical or >_<; no numeral in first position
>-< chars are interpreted as flagIdentifiers and therefore lead to a different error message
>!< chars have a special meaning: being replaced by the previous command in commandline-history

NOT WORKING ATM: the char ** method is partly in comments and the utils for that one don't work because
the datatype has changed to lists
the char ** method works except for some cases with unsetting and using PWD and HOME therfore i started changing to lists
 all new attempt files are in the "env.c" env is done; export and unset not yet
 the idea is to split the variable into <key> and <value> and to have an extra flag to determine printableness
